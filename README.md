Shopify Open Source
=====================

Shopify's Open Source page is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

All of the data comes from Jekyll. Any change in [index.html](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify.github.com/blob/master/index.html) (including whitespace commits - [e.g.](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify.github.com/commit/818fd9aeb05d9120c41a9af08819b4f191b4e76f)) will trigger a rebuild and update all of the numbers.

To include a repo in the list, add it to `optInRepos` in `javascripts/custom-repos.js`. The repo must be owned by Shopify. To include non-Shopify repos, use `customRepos`. Set a defined project language or custom avatar in the same file.

If you want to run it locally
--
1. Clone this branch or [download the zip](https://codeload.github.com/Shopify/shopify.github.com/zip/master) and navigate to the folder in terminal
2. Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
3. Install Sass: `gem install sass`
    * Use `sass -v` to make sure it worked
4. Install Compass: `gem install compass`
5. Make sure everything is setup with `bundle install`
6. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
7. In another terminal window, run `compass watch`
8. Access the page at `http://localhost:4000`

### Notes about local build
- `bundle exec jekyll serve` will compile the Jekyll and Sass files into static assets in the **_site** folder each time a file is saved. That folder is excluded from the repo.
- `compass watch` will update ie.css and main.css.
- Use `rake build` to manually parse SCSS files.
- Your local build will be nearly empty because:
  - The page uses Jekyll's `site.github.public_repositories` object to get the repo data. This data is only available when live.
  - Custom repo data is generated by Github's JS API, so it will show up locally.

### Content Management
- The content for each project comes from the GitHub Pages for that repo.
This can be from a `gh-pages` branch, or from the `/docs` directory, based on the [GitHub Pages settings].
Using the `/docs` directory is preferred as it's less confusing for contributors.
